Okay, rails says README.rdoc is for config info, so I'll leave that be and turn
this into a todo list. Which really should be todo.txt, but this one is 
displayed by default.

TODO:

###Document Manager

#####Document Editor

We need a web page to view and open documents. So far, we have a basic text
based editor, and a basic gui editor. Still to do:

1. Finish gui. 

2. Finish kale. the core function is very close to being done, the editor is 
probably going to be the same as the gui editor.

3. Document conversions. docx>kale, pdf>kale, gui>kale. Gui can just open 
compiled kale. 


#####Document Viewer

For students. 

1. Test taker with tab locking and timing.

2. Document viewer. For students.
